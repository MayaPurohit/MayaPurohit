# Introduction

I am Maya Purohit and I am a Dual-Degree student at Dartmouth and Colby College! I am majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and Electrical Engineering. I am excellent at coding in Java, Python, Matlab, R and C and 
would love to continue expanding my knowledge through a work experience. In the past, I have worked as an intern for Bigelow Laboratories on the government funded Coast to Cow to Consumer project. My responsibilities 
entailed building a time-series database for the project to keep a record of changes made in the seaweed industry. I believe my experience with data analysis and data structures will make me a valuable member on your team!
